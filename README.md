My graduation project for Computer Science Bachelor at Universidade Federal do ABC, Brazil.
## Structure
In each folder, you'll find the source code for the experiments. You'll need to download the databases and place them in the correct path (check .py files to do it properly).

[UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

[German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)): https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)

[Juvenile Criminal Reincidence](http://cejfe.gencat.cat/en/recerca/opendata/jjuvenil/reincidencia-justicia-menors/index.html): http://cejfe.gencat.cat/en/recerca/opendata/jjuvenil/reincidencia-justicia-menors/index.html

After downloading the databases and placing them in the right path, just run the .py files.
